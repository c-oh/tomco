###  Install the dev dependencies

You'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, eslint, Browsersync etc.

### Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy.


### SASS FILES:

There may be few lines of code in the sass files that don't seem to do anything, but they're styling either one of the plugins for the products (there's two plugins for products as one is kept as a backup in case anything happens).
